I'm a self-taught web developer working primarily with VueJS.

The technologies I currently use in my projects are:
-Vanilla Javascript/React.js/Vuejs
-Ruby
-Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap/Chakra UI
-Jest/React Testing Library
-MongoDB/Google Firebase/Cloud Firestore
-Chartjs/Apexcharts
-HTML/CSS
-Webpack
-Git

I'm also interested in Solidity language & blockchain development. I have a blog (built with NuxtJS) where I write about my Solidity learning journey => https://solidity.herokuapp.com/

-Soft skills? I have a Master's degree in communication/semiotics.

You can find my portfolio here

and my GitHub profile here

I have a tech-related blog where I write in English and in French. You can access it here
 => https://dev.to/muratcanyuksel

I speak :
-English
-French
-Turkish fluently
-can read the Cryllic alphabet, understand some Russian, Hungarian and Estonian.

I bloom wherever I'm planted, yet I feel more energetic in international, diverse environments.

 -I try to live by the idea of continuous growth, that is, trying to learn new things all the time. I believe William Blake was quite right when he wrote "Expect poison from the standing water."
