<h2> Hello, world! This is Murat</h2>

<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

I'm a self-taught web developer focusing on React.js. I follow The Odin Project's curriculum to avoid tutorial hell and learn by making projects. You can find my portfolio here => <a href="https://https://muratcan-yuksel.github.io/portfolio-1//"><img alt="Portfolio" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-https%3A%2F%2Fmuratcan--yuksel.github.io%2Fportfolio--1%2F-red"></a>

I also enjoy sharing what I've learned during my studies in my blog. I write in English and in French. You can access my blog here =>

During my education, I had the opportunity to enjoy various scholarships and study, work, live in different European countries like Hungary, Belgium, France and Estonia. I hold a Master's degree in Semiotics from the University of Tartu in Estonia , in which I studied one year of that Master's in l'Université Bordeaux-Montaigne in France to perfect my French. I speak English, French and Turkish fluently, can read the Cryllic alphabet, understand some Russian, Hungarian and Estonian.

I also worked in various retail jobs to finance my studies, each of them teaching me a different soft skill. I'm a relaxed person who performs well also under pressure. I try to live by the idea of continuous growth, that is, trying to learn new things all the time. I believe William Blake was quite right when he wrote "Expect poison from the standing water."

I'm open for a front-end developer role. Please feel free to contact me.
