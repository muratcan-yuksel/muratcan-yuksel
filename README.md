I'm a full stack blockchain developer & technical writer targeting EVM based chains with Solidity. I write smart contracts with Solidity, and use ReactJS, Hardhat and viem.sh (sometimes EthersJS) to interact with the smart contract.

At the present moment, I work as a freelancer. If you have a project in mind that you want to build, or you already have your project and look for a seasoned technical writer to help with documentation or bring users via SEO, hit me up and let's discuss!

-I have a Master's degree in communication/semiotics.

I post coding tutorials on my Youtube channel => https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1hJydcsPZCwbn8rPiohsg

I have a tech-related blog where I write in English and in French. You can access it here

I speak :
-English
-French
-Turkish fluently
-can read the Cyrillic alphabet, understand some Russian, Hungarian and Estonian.

I bloom wherever I'm planted, yet I feel more energetic in international, diverse environments.

-I try to live by the idea of continuous growth, that is, trying to learn new things all the time. I believe William Blake was quite right when he wrote "Expect poison from the standing water."

Please feel free to contact me.
