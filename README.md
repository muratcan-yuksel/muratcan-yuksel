I'm a full stack web developer. 

I build applications for the web as we know it as well as web3.

I have a year of professional experience in front end development. I also write coding tutorials to blogs such as LogRocket blog.


The technologies I currently use in my projects are:
-Vanilla Javascript/React.js/Vuejs/NextJS

-Jest/React Testing Library/Mocha/Chai

I have a tech-related blog where I write in English and in French. You can access it here
 => https://dev.to/muratcanyuksel

I speak :
-English
-French
-Turkish fluently
-can read the Cryllic alphabet, understand some Russian, Hungarian and Estonian.

I bloom wherever I'm planted, yet I feel more energetic in international, diverse environments.

 -I try to live by the idea of continuous growth, that is, trying to learn new things all the time. I believe William Blake was quite right when he wrote "Expect poison from the standing water."
